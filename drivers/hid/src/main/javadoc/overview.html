        A <a title="javahidapi homepage" href="http://code.google.com/p/javahidapi/">javahidapi project</a> bundle wrapper making HID USB devices available in OSGi.
        
        <p>
            This bundle provides a very simple integration of HID USB devices in
            your OSGi environment. The native drivers are loaded depending on your
            OS automatically. Each device is expose as an OSGi Service as a
            {@link com.codeminders.hidapi.HIDDeviceInfo } class. The service is
            annotated with properties found in the {@link com.cibuddy.hid.HIDServiceConstants }
            class. For more details, please refer to the {@link com.codeminders.hidapi } 
            and {@link com.cibuddy.hid } packages and its content.
