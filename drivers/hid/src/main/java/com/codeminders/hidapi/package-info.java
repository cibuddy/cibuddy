/**
 * This package is copied (and slightly modified) from the <a title="javahidapi homepage" href="http://code.google.com/p/javahidapi/">javahidapi project</a>.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The main differences between this and the javahidapi project are that not all
 * classes are present here and the code was enhanced on a few occasions, as well 
 * as the javadoc, to better support users of the library.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * To interact in OSGi with USB devices, look for <code>com.codeminders.hidapi.HIDDeviceInfo</code>
 * class based services. This library will expose all identified USB devices as
 * such services, so you should not worry about how to obtain those.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <b>Attention!</b>
 * <p>
 * In order to use the native code you have to ensure the proper environment is
 * available on you operating system. In case of Windows and Mac OS X, you should
 * be good to go. However on Linux libusb and others in a specific version are
 * required. Check these links to ensure everything works as expected:
