This project is based and the javahidapi project, which is licensed under 3 
different licenses. The license chosen in case of CIBuddy was the most liberal
one (found in LICENSE-HIDAP-orig.txt). This license only applies to the artifacts
taken from javahidapi (which are the native binaries located underneath the 
src/main/resources/lib folder and the classes found in the com.codeminders.hidapi).
However, as long as you're only using this bundle in a binary format, the CIBuddy 
project license is the one relevant for you.
